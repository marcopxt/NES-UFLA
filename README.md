#### 1. Download R and RStudio

 Use the following link to download R program and install it in your computer. It can be done for Windows, Linux and MAC systems. After the download and intallation of R, you can also download and install RStudio. RStudio is an IDE (integrated development environment). It basically makes your life easier

- Download R (https://cran.r-project.org/) 
- Download RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)


**Tip: go to this link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpptwObI1ps) that they will explain you everything that you need to download and install both tools**

#### 2. Introduction to R and RStudio

- Integration, IDE, console, R environment, and communities

<div id="pt3" />

#### 3. Basic functions in R language 

- mean, var, mode, length, dim, str

```r
data = rnorm(100,100,20)

mean(data)

var(data)

median(data)

length(data)

#dim(data)

str(data)

```

- data structure: matrix, dataframe, list, arrays

- setdw() command and saving projects

```r

getwd() #Your currently directory

setwd("C:/folder/folder/") #Your path

```

- Import and export/save datasets

```r
#reading your data
df = read.data("mydata.txt)

#Modifing
df1 = df/sqrt(df)

#saving the output

save.table(df1, file = "myoutput.txt)

```

#### 4. Download and install packages

- What is a package and how to install and use them

- CRAN and Github

<div id="pt5" />

#### 5. Models (AoV)

- Analyses of variance using the package ExpDes (Ferreira et al, 2021)

<div id="pt6" />

#### 6. Plotting using **ggplot2** package

- Installing the package ggplot2
- Organizing the dataset
- Types of graphs: boxplot, density, histogram, ...

```r
p = ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)

```

- Plotting the graph

```r
p

```
