#### 1. Download R and RStudio

Use the following link to download R program and install it in your computer. It can be done for Windows, Linux and MAC systems. After the download and intallation of R, you can also download and install RStudio. RStudio is an IDE (integrated development environment). It basically makes your life easier.

- Download R (https://cran.r-project.org/) 
- Download RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)


**Tip: go to this link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28bKdOtIgSY) that they will explain you everything that you need to download and install both tools**

<div id="pt2" />

#### 2. Introduction to R and RStudio

- Integration, IDE, console, R environment, and communities

<div id="pt3" />

#### 3. Basic functions in R language 

- mean, var, mode, length, dim, str

```r
data = rnorm(100,100,20)

mean(data)

var(data)

median(data)

length(data)

#dim(data)

str(data)

```

- data structure: matrix, dataframe, list, arrays

- setdw() command and saving projects

```r

getwd() #Your currently directory

setwd("C:/folder/folder/") #Your path

```

- Import and export/save datasets

```r
#reading your data
df = read.data("mydata.txt)

#Modifing
df1 = df/sqrt(df)

#saving the output

save.table(df1, file = "myoutput.txt)

```

<div id="pt4" />

#### 4. Download and install packages

- What is a package and how to install and use them

- CRAN and Github

<div id="pt5" />

#### 5. Models (AoV)

- Analyses of variance using the package ExpDes (Ferreira et al, 2021)

<div id="pt6" />

#### 6. Tukey test

- Implementation of tukey test

<div id="pt6" />

#### 7. Regression models

- Regression models

y = B0 + B1 + e

<div id="pt7" />

#### 8. Plotting using **ggplot2** package

- Installing the package ggplot2

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")

require(ggplot2)

``` 
- Organizing the dataset
- Using ggplot2
```r
ggplot(data, aes(x_, y_)) + #first line you should specify the data and x/y axes. 
  geom_point()              #Insert the type of graph that you want 

```

- Types of graphs: boxplot, density, histogram, point

Boxplot

```r
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)

```
Density

```r
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_density() 

```

Histogram

```r
p = ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_histogram() 

p

```

Point

```r
p = ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)

p

```

- Saving the graphs

```r

#saving (We can save several formats, like .tiff, .png, .jpeg or even .pdf)

tiff("filename.tiff", width = 16, height = 8, units = 'in', res = 300)
plot
dev.off()

```
